# Visual-Analysis-of-Global-Suicides-1985-2015
Introduction [Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016)
I found this data set in Kaggle and given my experience with volunteering for a hotline, I was interested in how suicide rates differ across different demographics and time. I believe suicide is a complex topic that can't be understood from just a dataset, therefore, I will only be exploring how suicide rates differ between different age groups, sexes, and countries instead of looking for correlations. As well as examine how the rates have changed over the past few years for various countries. I will not be looking at the "HDI for year" column as almost 2/3 of the data is missing, and I will be exploring the GDP column as I don't aim to find correlations.  I also believe that there is an issue with the "generation" column of the data and it was appended after the data was processed using the age and year group, which creates artificial spikes, I only found this out after creating a few graphs so I removed all the graphs including this column.
